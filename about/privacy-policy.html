    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>PhotoSolver</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you use the <strong>MathLens</strong> apps, websites, software, paid/premium features and subscriptions, and related services (the “<strong>Services</strong>”). MathLens uses AI to solve problems from photos you take with your camera or select from your photo library. This Policy is intended primarily for users in the United States and is designed to reflect requirements under U.S. laws (including California) while also describing choices and rights for users in other regions.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="who-we-are">1) Who We Are</h2>
  <p><strong>Controller:</strong> PhotoSolver (“PhotoSolver,” “Company”).</p>
  <p><strong>Support &amp; privacy contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:support@mathlens.com">support@mathlens.com</a></p>
  <p><strong>Scope:</strong> This Policy applies to the MathLens mobile applications, websites, and related online Services that link to or reference it.</p>

  <h2 id="what-we-collect">2) Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect information in three ways, consistent with the practices reflected in the sample policies you provided:</p>
  <h3>a) Information You Provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account &amp; Profile</strong> (e.g., name or username, email, password, grade/education level if provided).</li>
    <li><strong>User Content</strong> (e.g., images and problems you capture/upload for solving; text you type; feedback; attachments).</li>
    <li><strong>Messages &amp; Support</strong> (e.g., inquiries, bug reports, rights requests, and related correspondence).</li>
    <li><strong>Purchases</strong> (e.g., subscription status, product purchased, payment method details handled by our payment processors; we do not store full payment card numbers).</li>
    <li><strong>Surveys/Promotions</strong> (e.g., responses if you participate in surveys, research, contests, or marketing programs).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>b) Information Collected Automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical Data</strong> (e.g., IP address, app version, OS/device type, device identifiers, crash/diagnostic logs, language/region, approximate location derived from IP).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> (e.g., features used, time spent, search and view history, problem-solving workflow, subscription events).</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies/SDKs</strong> for functionality, security, analytics, and—where permitted—marketing. We obtain consent where required.</li>
    <li><strong>Camera/Library Access</strong>: Images you capture or select are processed to detect, understand, and solve problems and to improve recognition quality. See <a href="#ai">AI &amp; Model Improvement</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>c) Information From Other Sources</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Linked Accounts</strong> (e.g., sign in via a third-party identity provider).</li>
    <li><strong>Payments &amp; Fulfillment</strong> (e.g., confirmations from payment providers and app stores).</li>
    <li><strong>Reports from Others</strong> (e.g., policy complaints, IP takedown requests).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-we-use">3) How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use information to operate, provide, develop, and improve the Services, including to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide core features</strong>: solve problems from images, deliver explanations/hints, and operate accounts and subscriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Communicate &amp; support</strong>: notify about changes, respond to requests, and provide in‑app and email support.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve &amp; research</strong>: monitor performance; analyze usage; test and refine recognition and solution quality; enhance stability and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Process purchases</strong> and manage paid/premium features and subscriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety &amp; enforcement</strong>: detect, investigate, and address abuse, fraud, or terms/policy violations.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong>: comply with laws, regulations, and valid requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing</strong>: where permitted by law or with consent, send product updates, offers, surveys, and promotions (opt‑out anytime).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="ai">4) AI &amp; Model Improvement</h2>
  <p>MathLens uses AI to interpret and solve problems from images. We may use de‑identified problem images, text, and related metadata to improve recognition accuracy, solution steps, and app reliability (for example, to evaluate where the system fails and how to fix it). Where required by law, we will request consent or provide an in‑app control to opt out of contributing <em>your</em> content to product improvement beyond what is necessary to provide the Services. We do not use content obtained through restricted APIs in ways those APIs forbid.</p>

  <h2 id="sharing">5) How We Share Information</h2>
  <p>We share information as described below and consistent with your choices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers</strong> (e.g., cloud hosting/CDN, analytics, crash reporting, customer support, payments). They must follow our instructions and protect your information.</li>
    <li><strong>Third‑party integrations</strong> you choose (e.g., sign‑in, classroom platforms)—we share what’s needed to enable the feature.</li>
    <li><strong>Payments &amp; fulfillment</strong> (e.g., app stores and payment processors receive purchase‑related data and limited device info for fraud/security).</li>
    <li><strong>Corporate transactions</strong> (e.g., merger, acquisition, financing, sale, or bankruptcy) under appropriate safeguards.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal &amp; safety</strong> (e.g., to comply with law, respond to lawful requests, protect rights, safety, and integrity of the Services and users).</li>
    <li><strong>With your direction or consent</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may also share aggregate or de‑identified information that does not identify individuals.</p>

  <h2 id="your-rights">6) Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access, correction, deletion</strong>: You can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information. We may ask you to verify your identity.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt‑out of marketing</strong>: Use unsubscribe links in emails or adjust in‑app settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookie controls</strong>: Manage cookies via your browser/device and, where available, our in‑app or website cookie controls.</li>
    <li><strong>Appeals</strong>: If you disagree with a decision on your request, reply to our response to appeal.</li>
    <li><strong>Authorized agents (U.S.)</strong>: You can designate an agent to make requests on your behalf with proper authorization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="cookies">7) Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies</h2>
  <p>We use cookies/SDKs for essential functions, analytics, security, and—where permitted—marketing. You can manage cookies in your browser/device and, where required by law, we will obtain consent before placing non‑essential cookies.</p>

  <h2 id="ads">8) Advertising &amp; “Do Not Sell/Share”</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. Where state law defines “share” to include cross‑context behavioral advertising, you may opt out of such sharing via in‑app settings or by contacting us (see “Contact Us”). Opting out does not stop all ads but limits interest‑based ads as required.</p>
  <p><strong>Do Not Track (DNT):</strong> We do not respond to DNT browser signals because no standard is widely adopted. You may use our other privacy controls instead.</p>

  <h2 id="security">9) Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement technical, administrative, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls, segregation of environments, and monitoring). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2 id="retention">10) Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain information as long as needed to provide the Services and for legitimate business, security, and legal compliance purposes. Retention periods vary by category and context. We de‑identify or delete data when no longer needed.</p>

  <h2 id="transfers">11) International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>We may process and store data in the United States and other countries. Where applicable, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., contractual clauses) for cross‑border transfers and comply with local law requirements.</p>

  <h2 id="children">12) Children &amp; Students</h2>
  <p>The Services are not directed to children under 13, and children under 13 may not use MathLens without verified parental consent consistent with U.S. COPPA. If we learn we collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will delete it. Where schools authorize use for students, we process student data as directed by the school/teacher and in accordance with applicable student privacy laws.</p>

  <h2 id="payments">13) Payments &amp; Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>MathLens offers paid/premium features and subscriptions. Purchases are processed by app stores or payment processors; we receive limited billing metadata and subscription status. Please review the applicable app store/payment provider policies for details on their processing, recurring billing, refunds, and dispute rights.</p>

  <h2 id="us-rights">14) U.S. State Privacy Disclosures (including California)</h2>
  <p>If you reside in a U.S. state with comprehensive privacy law (e.g., CA, CO, CT, UT, VA), you may have rights to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Know</strong> categories of personal information collected, sources, purposes, and categories of recipients.</li>
    <li><strong>Access/Portability</strong> a copy of personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> personal information (subject to exceptions).</li>
    <li><strong>Correct</strong> inaccurate personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt out</strong> of “sale” or “sharing” for cross‑context behavioral advertising and limit use of sensitive personal information, where applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Appeal</strong> a decision on your request.</li>
    <li><strong>Non‑discrimination</strong> for exercising your rights.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How to exercise:</strong> Email <a href="mailto:support@mathlens.com">support@mathlens.com</a> from the email associated with your account (or provide sufficient information to verify your identity). You may designate an authorized agent with proof of authority.</p>
  <p><strong>No Sale/Sharing:</strong> We do not sell personal information. We only “share” for cross‑context advertising where permitted and provide an opt‑out as required.</p>
  <p><strong>Sensitive Data:</strong> We handle any sensitive categories only as necessary to provide the Services or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>

  <h2 id="intl">15) Users Outside the U.S. (EEA/UK &amp; others)</h2>
  <p>If you are in the EEA/UK, we process personal data under lawful bases such as contract (to provide the Services), legitimate interests (to improve, secure, and support the Services), legal obligation, and consent (e.g., for certain marketing/cookies). You may have rights to access, delete, correct, port, restrict, or object, and to withdraw consent at any time. You can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mathlens.com">support@mathlens.com</a>. Where we transfer data outside your region, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) as required.</p>

  <h2 id="principles">16) Privacy Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lawfulness, fairness, transparency</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Purpose limitation &amp; minimization</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy &amp; storage limitation</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Security &amp; confidentiality</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Privacy by design &amp; by default</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="changes">17) Changes to this Policy</h2>
