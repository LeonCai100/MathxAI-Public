    <p>Welcome to <strong>MathLens</strong>. These Terms of Service (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) are a legally binding agreement between you and <strong>PhotoSolver</strong> (“<strong>PhotoSolver</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) governing your access to and use of the MathLens mobile application, related websites, software, and services (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”).</p>
    <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> (the “Privacy Policy”). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>
    <div class="note"><strong>Educational Use Notice.</strong> MathLens uses AI to analyze photos you capture with your camera or import from your library to help you understand and solve problems (e.g., math/science). MathLens is a <em>study aid</em>, not a substitute for learning. Do not use MathLens to violate academic integrity rules.</div>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided by <strong>PhotoSolver</strong> (USA). You can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@mathlens.com">support@mathlens.com</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Jurisdiction-specific terms.</em> Different terms may apply to you based on where you live (e.g., UK/EEA consumer rights). Please read Section 22 (Region-Specific Terms) and Appendix A (UK/EEA Withdrawal Rights) if applicable.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility &amp; Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Minimum age.</strong> You must be at least <strong>13</strong> years old (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction) to use the Service. If you are under the age of majority where you live, you represent that you have <strong>parent or legal guardian consent</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Age verification.</strong> We may request proof of age or parental consent and may suspend or terminate accounts that do not meet these requirements or provide false information.</li>
      <li><strong>Account registration.</strong> Certain features require an account. You must provide accurate, current information and keep it updated. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account and for keeping your password confidential. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. What MathLens Does (and Doesn’t)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>MathLens allows you to capture or upload photos and uses AI to analyze them and generate explanations, steps, or suggested answers.</li>
      <li><strong>AI is probabilistic.</strong> Outputs may be incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate in certain cases. Always verify with authoritative sources.</li>
      <li><strong>No professional advice.</strong> Outputs are for informational/educational purposes only and are <strong>not</strong> medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice.</li>
      <li><strong>Academic integrity.</strong> Do not use MathLens to cheat on exams, quizzes, or assignments or to otherwise violate institutional policies.</li>

    <h2>11. Modifications, Updates &amp; Availability</h2>
    <p>We may add or remove features, change usage limits, or discontinue part or all of the Service. We may also update the Service for security, legal, or technical reasons and may require you to install updates. Where changes materially and adversely affect you, we will provide reasonable advance notice when practicable. Descriptions of the Service are not guarantees that features will always remain available.</p>

    <h2>12. Export &amp; Sanctions</h2>
    <p>You may not use or export the Service in violation of U.S. or other applicable export control and sanctions laws (including to embargoed countries/regions or restricted parties).</p>

    <h2>13. Copyright &amp; IP Complaints (DMCA)</h2>
    <p>If you believe material on the Service infringes your copyright or other IP rights, please submit a notice including: (a) your contact details; (b) identification of the work(s) claimed to be infringed; (c) identification/URL of the allegedly infringing material; (d) your good-faith statement; (e) a statement that the information is accurate and you are the rights holder or authorized agent; and (f) your signature.</p>

    <h2>14. Translations</h2>
    <p>MathLens or related materials may be translated for convenience (including machine translation). The <strong>official text is English</strong>. If questions arise, the English version controls.</p>

    <h2>15. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE AND ALL OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED <strong>“AS IS”</strong> AND <strong>“AS AVAILABLE.”</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PHOTOSOLVER DISCLAIMS <strong>ALL WARRANTIES</strong>, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING <strong>MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,</strong> AND <strong>ACCURACY</strong>. WE DO NOT WARRANT UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OPERATION, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SERVICE IS FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOU USE THE SERVICE (INCLUDING AI OUTPUTS) <strong>AT YOUR OWN RISK</strong>.</p>

    <h2>16. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PHOTOSOLVER AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND PARTNERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR <strong>INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES</strong>, OR FOR <strong>LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS</strong>, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR <strong>TOTAL LIABILITY</strong> FOR ALL CLAIMS <strong>WILL NOT EXCEED</strong> THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SERVICE IN THE <strong>12 MONTHS</strong> BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY (OR <strong>$50</strong> IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID).</p>
    <p>Nothing in these Terms limits liability where it would be unlawful to do so (e.g., fraud, death or personal injury caused by negligence). Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; where prohibited, the relevant limitation will not apply.</p>

    <h2>17. Indemnity (Business/Institutional Use)</h2>
    <p>If you use the Service for or on behalf of a business, you will <strong>indemnify and hold harmless</strong> PhotoSolver from and against any third-party claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your unlawful use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of third-party rights.</p>

    <h2>18. Suspension &amp; Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service (or any part) if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach these Terms; (b) we are required to do so by law or court order; (c) your use poses risk or harm to users, us, or third parties; or (d) you are a repeat IP infringer. You may stop using the Service at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive (including 5–7, 9–10, 12–20, 22, and Appendix A) will survive termination.</p>

    <h2>19. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms (for example, to reflect new features, pricing, or legal requirements). The “Last Updated” date shows the current version. Where changes <strong>materially</strong> affect your rights, we will provide reasonable advance notice when practicable. If you continue using the Service after changes become effective, you accept the updated Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.</p>

    <h2>20. Assignment; No Waiver; Severability; Third-Party Rights</h2>
    <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign or delegate these Terms (in whole or part) at any time. Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver. If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder remains in full force. Except as expressly stated in Section 23 (App Stores), these Terms create no third-party beneficiary rights.</p>

    <h2>21. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution (U.S.)</h2>
    <p><strong>Governing Law.</strong> Except as otherwise required by law where you reside, these Terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>State of California</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules.<br>
    <strong>Venue.</strong> You and PhotoSolver agree to the <strong>exclusive jurisdiction and venue</strong> of the state or federal courts located in <strong>Santa Clara County, California, USA</strong> for any disputes that are not subject to arbitration as set out below, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>

    <h3>21.1 Arbitration &amp; Class-Action Waiver (U.S. Users)</h3>
    <p><strong>Please read this carefully.</strong> Except for claims that qualify for <strong>small claims court</strong>, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be resolved by <strong>binding arbitration</strong> administered by the <strong>American Arbitration Association (AAA)</strong> under its <strong>Consumer Arbitration Rules</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Class/representative actions are not permitted.</strong> YOU AND PHOTOSOLVER <strong>WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</strong> AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</li>
      <li><strong>30-day opt-out.</strong> You may opt out of arbitration by sending written notice to <a href="mailto:support@mathlens.com">support@mathlens.com</a> within 30 days of first accepting these Terms (subject: “Arbitration Opt-Out”), including your name, the email tied to your account, and a clear statement that you opt out.</li>
      <li>This clause does not apply where prohibited by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>22. Region-Specific Terms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>EEA/UK/Switzerland consumers.</strong> Where required by law, these Terms and any disputes are governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you may bring claims in your local courts. You may have statutory digital-content guarantees and <strong>withdrawal rights</strong> for direct purchases from us (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>).</li>
      <li><strong>Brazil.</strong> To the extent Brazilian consumer law applies, local mandatory rights remain unaffected.</li>
      <li><strong>Australia.</strong> Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits <strong>Australian Consumer Law</strong> guarantees that cannot be excluded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(If any local-law mandatory right conflicts with these Terms, the local right controls to the minimum extent required.)</p>

    <h2>23. App Store Terms</h2>
    <p><strong>Apple.</strong> These Terms are between you and PhotoSolver, not Apple. Apple is not responsible for the app or its content and has no obligation to provide maintenance or support. In case of non-conformity, Apple may refund the purchase price (if any). Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them against you.</p>
    <p><strong>Google Play.</strong> If you download via Google Play, the <strong>Google Play Terms of Service</strong> and applicable policies apply in case of conflict regarding use, billing, and refunds for in-app purchases.</p>

    <h2>24. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>Neither party is liable for delay or failure to perform due to events beyond reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, acts of government, war, terrorism, riots, strikes excluding your payment obligations), provided the affected party uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate.</p>

    <h2>25. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>These Terms (including the Privacy Policy and any additional terms incorporated by reference) constitute the <strong>entire agreement</strong> between you and PhotoSolver regarding the Service and supersede prior or contemporaneous agreements on the subject matter.</p>

    <h2>26. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about these Terms or the Service, contact: <a href="mailto:support@mathlens.com">support@mathlens.com</a>.</p>
